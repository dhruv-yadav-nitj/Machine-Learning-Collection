# Machine-Learning-Collection

This repository contains implementations of various classic machine learning algorithms and state-of-the-art deep learning models, built from scratch using PyTorch as the primary framework.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
- [Linear Regressiong Using Gradient Descent](https://github.com/dhruv-yadav-nitj/Machine-Learning-Collection/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regression/linear-regression.py)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/dhruv-yadav-nitj/Machine-Learning-Collection/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regression/linear-regression.py)
- [Support Vector Machine]()

## PyTorch
- [Coming Soon]

## Architecture Implementations
- [Coming Later]
