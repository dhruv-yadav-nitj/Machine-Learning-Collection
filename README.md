# Machine Learning Collection

This repository contains implementations of various classic machine learning algorithms, state-of-the-art deep learning models and architectural implementations of various papers, built from scratch using PyTorch as the primary framework.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
- [Linear Regression Using Gradient Descent](https://github.com/dhruv-yadav-nitj/Machine-Learning-Collection/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regression/linear-regression.py)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/dhruv-yadav-nitj/Machine-Learning-Collection/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regression/linear-regression.py)
- [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/dhruv-yadav-nitj/Machine-Learning-Collection/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Support%20Vector%20Machines/svm.py)
